# Robust Reinforcement Learning Hand-in branch

This branch is meant as the final hand-in for the robust Reinforcement learning bachelor's thesis by Calle Ryge Carlsen and Karl Meisner-Jensen. We are not planning any commits after the date of the hand-in (02/06 23:59), but if there are, they are not meant as part of the grading. Before hand-in, unused files were moved or deleted, whether this has broken functionality is improbably but possible. In the case of not-working files, we refer to the main branch of the project, specifically the commits made before the hand-in deadline. \\

The raw data for the cliffcar and sumo models can be found in cliff_car/test_results and in sumo/test_results respectively. Plots used in the repot are in the plots folder. \\

The requirements.txt file should hold all packages required for running any script within the folder. \\

The Python files for running the experiments sumo/DQN_sumo_experiments.py, sumo/sumo_slow_experiments.py, sumo/sumo_experiments.py, cliff_car/cliff_car_experiments.py, cliff_car/cliff_car_slow.py and cliff_car/cliff_car_DQN.py \\

Demos of the environments can be found by running sumo/sumo-pp.py and cliff_car/cliff_car_again.py respectively \\
